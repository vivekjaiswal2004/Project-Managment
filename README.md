# Project-Managment

This project is a simple web application that displays a list of projects in a clean and user-friendly interface. Each project card shows its title, description, and date created. A built-in search and filter feature helps users quickly find projects based on keywords.

The system can be connected to a backend (like Django) to fetch real project data from a database, or it can work with sample static data for demo purposes. The design is responsive, ensuring it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
